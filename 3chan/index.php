		Welcome to 3chan.<br><br>

3chan is an anonymous imageboard similar to 4chan where users can create and reply to threads.<br><br>

The motivating factor behind creating 3chan was protecting and cultivating freedom of speech. True freedom of speech. Which doesn’t just mean allowing people to post freely but also protecting zones where more taboo subjects are being discussed. <br><br>

Specifically, /pol/, or the politically incorrect board, which has been infiltrated by paid interest groups and their seemingly infinite number of lackeys, use divide and conquer strategies with the objective to skew discussion, create chaos, muddy ideas, and instill unbridled hatred amongst people simply trying to find truth. By doing this, we believe that these paid interest groups are impeding on /pol/’s freedom of speech and we at 3chan are dedicated to protecting the speech and the more important ideas of /pol/. <br><br>

What /pol/ has brought to light in the recent years regarding the secrecy, corruption, and wickedness of the elite has been shocking and the importance of protecting an area where people are freely allowed to talk about these issues is NECESSARY for any society that wishes to further improve itself. The media has failed us and it is up to all of us, neigh, our duty, to expose this evil plot to the people and energize them to take their governments back from corrupt politicians, globalist corporations, and the international banking cartel. <br><br>

While the other boards on 3chan are still important the importance of /pol/’s role in our society CANNOT be understated. What /pol/ needs more than anything right now is a community that understands the movement and the enemy and is imbued with the fiery ideals of justice and transparency within our higher institutions. <br><br>

Your move.
